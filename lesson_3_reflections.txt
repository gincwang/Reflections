When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you need to collaborate on a project with others, or would like to share your work with others to critique.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you could be working on the same file, and if it's automatically pulled your progress could be erased.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are the clone between repositories on github website. It is used for getting your own copy of the code on github.
Clones are used when you want to clone a remote repository into your local machine. 
Branches are different scenarios of your code where you want to try out different features and such without affecting other branches of code. It is used on your local repository only.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
This way we can have a backup of the remote, and we can have the flexibility to choose whether we want to merge with the new changes or create a new branch for it.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It would be easier to make changes and amendments to code, but it would be harder to keep track of changes and merging code by different people.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Pretty much anytime you collaborate on the code with someone else, you should make changes only in separate branches so that people fully agree with your changes first before committing that change into the master. Of course, making changes in separate branches is more tedious, but it makes sure you won't accidentally break somethihng in your master and cause bugs for others.
